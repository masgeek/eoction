<p>Welcome to Eoction! You are now reading our Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>"), an agreement between you and
    Eoction, Inc. ("<strong>Eoction</strong>"), for your use of our online platform and service, which connects people
    selling items online ("<strong>Sellers</strong>") with people who want to purchase those items
    ("<strong>Buyers</strong>"). The platform and service are available at <a href="https://eoction.com/">https://eoction.com</a>
    (the "<strong>Site</strong>") and on our mobile device application (the "<strong>App</strong>"). To make these Terms
    easier to read, our online platform and service, the Site and the App are collectively called the
    "<strong>Services</strong>."</p>
<p>If you are a Seller, these Terms apply to you. If you're a Buyer, your Terms of Use are available at <a
        href="https://eoction.com/terms">https://eoction.com/terms</a>. Please read these Terms and our Privacy Policy
    (available at <a href="https://eoction.com/privacy">https://eoction.com/privacy</a>) carefully, because they govern
    your use of the Services. If you have any questions feel free to <a href="https://eoction.com/topics">contact us</a>.
    We want you to feel comfortable using the Services and will happily answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU ARE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY OR
    OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE
    SPECIFIED IN THE "DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR CONSUMERS" SECTION BELOW, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES
    DESCRIBED IN THE "DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR CONSUMERS" SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Eoction
    WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
    PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
<h2>What We Do and What We Don't Do</h2>
<p>We want to make it clear that Eoction is a technology services and platform provider and not a retailer. Through the
    Services, we offer a technology service and platform to allow Buyers and Sellers to connect. Sellers can sign up to
    the Services and offer their items for sale, including through an auction, by posting a Product
    ("<strong>Product</strong>"). Buyers can sign up to the Services if they want to bid on and/or purchase such items.
</p>
<p>We don't sell any items ourselves. Our responsibilities under these Terms are limited solely to facilitating the
    availability of our technology services and platform.</p>
<p>We use third parties to process payments and to payout funds to Sellers. To the extent we accept, hold or transmit
    funds in connection with a Product, we do so as an agent of the applicable Seller.</p>
<p>Your access to the Services and your Product and sale of any items through the Services are at your own risk and we
    disclaim all warranties, express or implied, and limit our liability in these Terms.</p>
<h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to these Terms, do not use the
    Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal
    entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these
    Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.</p>
<h2>Use of the Services</h2>
<p>You may use the Services only if you are of legal age and have the capacity to form a binding contract and are not a
    person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You may
    use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international
    laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The Services that Eoction provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Eoction provides
    may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Eoction may need to stop (permanently or
    temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally if we
    determine it necessary and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.</p>
<p>In order to use certain Services (for example, to create a Product), you will need to register with Eoction, create a
    username and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the registration form, including a valid
    email address. In addition, in order to sell on Eoction we may ask you to provide details regarding yourself, your
    business, sales history, employees and other information that we deem relevant. We may review your application and
    registration forms and may approve or deny your request to create a Seller account in our sole discretion. We may
    also remove your ability to sell on Eoction after you have first been approved, at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>You may not create more than one Seller account on Eoction without prior approval from us. You may not use a username
    for the purpose of impersonating another person or entity, including staff or any other representative of Eoction.
    We reserve the right to remove or reclaim inactive usernames or usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals
    that hold trademark or other legal claim on those usernames.</p>
<p>By creating an account, you agree to abide by these Terms and provide accurate information. Unless you are an agent
    authorized to bind another person and you are acting under their direction, you may not create an account for anyone
    other than yourself. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if any information provided proves to
    be inaccurate, false, or otherwise in violation of these Terms.</p>
<p>You may also link your Eoction account with your account on third party sites, such as Facebook (such account, a
    "<strong>Third-Party Account</strong>"). If you provide your Third-Party Account credentials to us or otherwise link
    your Eoction account with a Third-Party Account, we'll extract certain personal information, such as your name and
    email address, and other personal or contact information that your privacy settings on such Third-Party Account
    permit us to access.</p>
<h2>Passwords</h2>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services. You agree to take sole
    responsibility for any activities or actions under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities
    or actions. We encourage you to use strong passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case
    letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must immediately notify Eoction of any unauthorized use of your
    account, or if you have reason to believe that your password was lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized third
    party, or otherwise may have been compromised. Eoction is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your
    failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
<h2>No Endorsement; No Employment</h2>
<p>We welcome all Sellers to apply to sell on Eoction, as long as you are selling or offering to sell items that aren't
    illegal and comply with these Terms. However, we don't endorse any Sellers or any items they may offer for sale
    through the Services. Posting a Product on the Services does not mean you or your items are endorsed by us in any
    way. We reserve the right to conduct background checks on any seller and you agree to cooperate with us and to
    provide us with all information we request from you in the event that we decide to conduct a background check on
    you. We're not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your communications or interactions with a Buyer.
    By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions
    of Buyers or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the Buyers or other third parties who caused you
    harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on us, or seek any legal remedy from us with respect to such
    actions or omissions.</p>
<p>Sellers are not employees, agents or otherwise contractors of Eoction and we do not, in any way, supervise, direct,
    or control a Seller. Nothing in these Terms will be construed as establishing an employment or agency relationship
    between Eoction and you or any of your personnel. You have no authority to bind Eoction by contract or
    otherwise.</p>
<h2>Selling</h2>
<p>If you use the Services to sell items, you agree to abide by rules and policies which are described in detail on the
    Eoction <a href="http://help.eoction.com/">help section</a> and in the Services ("<strong>Seller Rules</strong>"),
    which are hereby incorporated by reference. In the event of any conflict between the text in these Terms and
    Conditions and the Seller Rules, the Seller Rules will govern. If you do not agree to these Seller Rules, do not
    post Products for sale. Failure to comply with any of the Seller Rules may result in your account being suspended or
    banned from participating in the Services.</p>
<h3>Products</h3>
<p>When you create a Product you'll need to provide certain information about your item, including a description,
    starting bid and/or "Buy Now" price, expected shipment date, and shipping costs (if any), warranty (if any), and any
    other applicable terms of the sale. It's important that such information be complete and accurate and comply with
    our category-specific terms, as outlined in our <a
        href="https://eoction.com/topics/Selling/subtopics/Listing%20Guidelines">Product Listing Guidelines</a>
    ("<strong>Product Listing Guidelines</strong>"). For additional information about how to create a Product, please
    see our <a href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1656619">Product Listing How-To</a>. You agree
    that you're responsible for all Products you post. We want to be able to publish as many Products as possible, but
    we reserve the right to remove a Product for any reason in our absolute discretion.</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between the text in these Terms and Conditions and the Seller Rules or Product Listing
    Guidelines, the conflict will be resolved in the following order of preference: (1) Product Listing Guidelines; (2)
    Seller Rules; and (3) these Terms. If you do not agree to the Product Listing Guidelines and Seller Rules, do not
    list items for sale. Failure to comply with any of the Product Listing Guidelines and Seller Rules may result in
    your account being suspended or banned from participating in the Services.</p>
<h3>Sales</h3>
<p>As a Seller, you decide the starting bid price at which to list your items on the Service ("<strong>Starting
        Bid</strong>"). Items can be sold either through an auction or as a "Buy Now" sale. Most Eoction auctions have
    no reserve prices, so your Starting Bid represents a binding offer to sell your item at that opening bid or any
    higher amount. If a Buyer wins the auction or elects to purchase an item through the "Buy Now" feature, they will be
    asked to pay the winning bid amount or the applicable "Buy Now" price (the "<strong>Sale Price</strong>"). No sale
    will be deemed complete unless and until Eoction provides you with a confirmation of the sale through the Services
    (a "<strong>Confirmed Sale</strong>").</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Products and sales made through the Services are subject to payment of certain fees, which are described on our page
    titled "<a href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/367067">Do I have to pay fees to sell?</a>"
    (the "<strong>Fees</strong>"). The percentages and fixed amounts for the Fees for any Product or sale vary by seller
    and category and are available in the <a href="https://eoction.com/seller/terms">Active Seller Terms section</a> of
    your account ("<strong>Active Terms</strong>"). Inactive fees terms will appear in your account under the &lsquo;Confirmation
    Required' heading. Sellers must first confirm the Fees for any category before they will be able to receive
    Confirmed Sales in that category. Unless otherwise stated, all Fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. The applicable Fees
    will be deducted from the payment of the Sale Price paid by the Buyer prior to the funds being released to your
    account.</p>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>Subject to these Terms, the Services may facilitate payments to, and refunds from, Sellers. Payments and refunds
    facilitated by the Services are processed by third parties. If, and to the extent, Eoction accepts, holds or
    transmits funds in connection with your Confirmed Sale, you agree that Eoction does so, on your behalf, as your
    limited agent and you hereby appoint Eoction as your limited agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments
    from, and refunding payments to, Buyers on your behalf. You agree that Eoction may use third parties to process
    payments, refunds or payouts through the Services and that Eoction has no obligation to accept, hold or transmit
    funds on your behalf. In accepting appointment as your limited agent, Eoction assumes no liability for any of your
    acts or omissions. You agree that, in accordance with <a
        href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2685187">Eoction's refund policy</a>, the Buyer may
    cancel a purchase and we may refund to the Buyer the amount specified in such refund policy.</p>
<p>When a Buyer pays you, the applicable Fees are automatically deducted from the payment before it is paid to you.
    Payment will be disbursed to you twice a month, provided that the aggregate amount to be disbursed to you exceeds
    $5.00, on a date selected by Eoction, after delivery of the item has been confirmed through the tracking information
    you provide in connection with shipment (as further described below) or, if delivery cannot be confirmed, 21 days
    after you mark the item as being shipped and the order shows an acceptance scan from a carrier. Additionally, if a
    return request is opened by the Buyer prior to the payment being disbursed, payment will be held until the case is
    resolved.</p>
<p>Eoction uses third parties, including Dwolla, Inc. and Payoneer Inc. to originate credit transfers to your financial
    institution account. You expressly authorize Eoction's service providers, Dwolla, Inc. and/or Payoneer, Inc. to
    originate credit transfers to your financial institution account. You also authorize Eoction and Eoction's payment
    processors to correct any mistakes in payments made by or to you, including any processing errors we discover, by
    debiting or crediting your financial institution account.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>You agree to ship items purchased by Buyers promptly after payment, but in no event longer than the processing date
    you indicate in your Product. Each shipment is required to ship with a valid tracking number. For detailed shipping
    requirements, please review our page titled "<a href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/900481">What
        are the shipping requirements?</a>".</p>
<p>Sellers can also purchase shipping labels through the Services. The costs of such labels will be disclosed to you at
    the time of purchase and will be will be deducted from the payment of the Sale Price by the Buyer prior to the funds
    being released to your account. For additional information on how to purchase postage for your sold items, please
    review our page titled "<a href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1616316">How do I purchase a
        shipping label?</a>".</p>
<h3>Refunds</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that each Confirmed Sale will be subject to Eoction's refund policy, available <a
        href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2685187">here</a>. If a Buyer cancels a Purchase and
    requests a refund after payment but before the Seller has indicated that the item has been shipped ("<strong>Marked
        as Shipped</strong>") the refund will be issued and the Seller will be billed. In addition, if a shipment is
    refused, undeliverable as addressed or returned to you without being delivered, you agree to issue a full refund.
</p>
<p>If a full refund is issued shortly after an order is paid, the Purchase is voided prior to any Fees being billed. If
    you issue a full refund after the payment has been disbursed to you, Eoction will reimburse the Buyer directly and
    you will be invoiced for any amount disbursed to you in connection with the sale, provided that Eoction will credit
    you for any Fees paid. In other words, in either case, you will not pay any Fees on the transaction excluding any
    fees associated with purchasing shipping labels that have been used.</p>
<p>If you issue a partial refund to a Buyer, we will invoice you for the refunded amount, provided that Eoction will
    include a pro-rated credit for the applicable commission. For example, if it's a $12 sale and you refund the
    customer $2, we will credit you the commission difference between a $12 sale and a $10 sale.</p>
<p>You can void purchased shipping labels if they have not yet been scanned, and you will receive a refund of the
    applicable purchase price. However, purchased shipping labels that have been scanned as accepted cannot be voided or
    reimbursed. In other words, if an order is refunded after delivery, you will not receive a credit for the shipping
    label fees.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase a shipping label from Eoction and receive a package that is returned
    to sender due to a bad address, Eoction may reimburse you in its sole discretion. Please contact customer support
    for more information.</p>
<h3>Taxes</h3>
<p>As used in these Terms, "<strong>Tax</strong>" or "<strong>Taxes</strong>" mean sales taxes, value added taxes (VAT),
    goods and services taxes (GST), and other similar municipal, state and federal direct, indirect or other withholding
    and personal or corporate income taxes imposed on a Seller or on amounts collected from Buyers.</p>
<p>As a Seller, you have to determine your own Tax reporting and payment requirements. You can do this in consultation
    with a tax advisor if you like. We don't and can't offer Tax-related advice to any Sellers &ndash; we leave that to
    the experts! Please note that you are responsible for determining any applicable Taxes on your items or on the
    amounts collected by us on your behalf. <strong>We recommend considering potential Tax implications in setting your
        Starting Bid as you are responsible for accounting for all applicable Taxes from the Sale Price.</strong> We are
    not responsible for determining the amount of, or invoicing Buyers for, Taxes.</p>
<h3>Your Obligations</h3>
<p>You agree to pay the applicable Fees, to assume full responsibility for the content of your Product and your items
    offered for sale. You agree to display information accurately about your Products, to ship items purchased by Buyers
    promptly after payment, to adhere to all Product Listing Guidelines and to respond to enquiries from Eoction in a
    timely manner. You will not list any items that are prohibited by law or are otherwise listed as prohibited in our
    article <a href="http://help.eoction.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1967261">What can't be sold on Eoction</a>. You
    will not engage with any bidders in manipulative or deceptive bidding, including shill bidding, as described in the
    Eoction <a href="https://eoction.com/topics">help section</a>. You will not transfer your Eoction account, including
    feedback and your user ID, to any other party without our consent.</p>
<h2>Liability and Disputes</h2>
<p>You understand and agree that we don't act as your insurer, broker, contracting agent or other representative, other
    than as noted in the Payments section above. If a Buyer purchases an item from you, any contract that you enter into
    with the Buyer, written or oral, will be between you and the Buyer only. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not
    us, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any contracts with Buyers, and we are not a party to such
    contracts and disclaim all liability arising from or related to such contracts.</p>
<p>Eoction does not have any control over or liability for the quality, safety, legality, descriptions, photos, or other
    aspect of the items listed for sale, nor does Eoction have any control over or liability for the accuracy,
    truthfulness, quality, or other aspect of the materials and information associated with Products. Eoction is not
    liable or responsible for defective items. If an item sold on Eoction is delivered in a defective condition, a
    Buyer's sole remedy is with the Seller.</p>
<p>If a Buyer has any concerns about you or your items, they may contact you through the Services or contact Eoction,
    which will reach out to you, to try and resolve their concerns. On the same note, if you have any concerns about a
    Buyer's purchase, you should contact Eoction.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, Eoction reserves the right in its sole discretion to resolve disputes between Buyers
    and Sellers. You agree that Eoction has the right to make the final decision in any dispute where Eoction chooses to
    intervene. If we resolve a dispute in the Buyer's favor, we may, but are not required to, issue a refund for up to
    the full cost of the item in dispute, including shipping, and require the Seller to reimburse us for the full amount
    refunded, including, in some cases, shipping costs. The foregoing paragraph states Eoction's entire liability and
    obligation to Buyers and Sellers in connection with any dispute between such parties.</p>
<h2>Buyer/Seller Feedback</h2>
<p>Users may submit feedback information regarding Sellers and Buyers that use the Services. You may only use the rating
    and feedback features for the bona-fide purpose of submitting feedback regarding the experience you had. Any other
    use of the feedback system is prohibited. You may not threaten to withhold refunds in order to avoid negative
    feedback or receive benefits beyond those to which you are entitled and you may not submit feedback for the purpose
    of manipulating another user's rating. Feedback information submitted by a user may be made available through the
    Services to other users.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Any personal information that you provide to us is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and
    use of your personal information. You understand that by using the Services you consent to the collection and use
    (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United
    States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Eoction.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>As part of the Services we provide, you may (if enabled) receive notifications, alerts or other types of messages via
    text message, email or the messaging functionality provided by the Services ("<strong>Messages</strong>"). You have
    control over the Messages settings, and can opt in or out of these Messages (with the exception of infrequent,
    important service announcements and administrative messages) either through your account or by following the
    unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive. Please be aware that third party messaging fees may
    occur for some of the Messages depending on the message plan you have with your wireless carrier.</p>
<p><strong>If you provide your cellular phone number and agree to receive communications from Eoction, you specifically
        authorize Eoction to send text messages or calls to your phone. You are not required to consent to receive text
        messages or calls as a condition of using the Services and may opt out of such messages. You can opt out of
        receiving text messages through your account settings.</strong></p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>For purposes of these Terms: (i) "<strong>Content</strong>" means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio,
    video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or
    otherwise made available through the Services; and (ii) "<strong>User Content</strong>" means any Content that
    Buyers and Sellers (including you) provide to be made available through the Services (including Content associated
    with your Products). Content includes without limitation User Content.</p>
<p>All Content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content, including its legality,
    reliability, and appropriateness. We do not monitor or control the Content posted via the Services, and we cannot
    take responsibility for such Content. Any use of or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or
    obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.</p>
<p>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any
    Content or communications posted via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to
    Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that
    have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Eoction be liable in any way for any
    Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind
    incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the
    Services or broadcast elsewhere.</p>
<p>Eoction may offer a catalog of items, which may include photos, descriptions, and other information provided by third
    parties. Eoction cannot guarantee that the information contained in such catalog will be accurate or up to date, and
    you agree not to hold such third party Content providers, or Eoction, responsible for any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Eoction grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    non-sublicensable license to access and view the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the
    Services.</p>
<h2>Your User Content</h2>
<p>Your User Content will be viewable by other users of the Services. You should only make available information or
    provide User Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms. You are responsible for your
    use of the Services, for any User Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your
    User Content by other users and our third party partners. Any Content you provide must comply with the Seller Rules,
    as described in the <a href="https://eoction.com/topics">help section</a> (which are hereby incorporated by
    reference and are part of these Terms and describe what content is prohibited on the Services).</p>
<p>Eoction is not responsible or liable for any use of your User Content by Eoction in accordance with these Terms. You
    represent and warrant that (i) you have all the rights, power and authority necessary (you own it or have the right
    to use it) to grant the rights granted herein to any User Content submitted; and (ii) your User Content or your use
    and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services does not violate any privacy rights,
    publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person or entity or
    result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p>You may request removal of your User Content from the Services at any time by specifically deleting it or sending a
    request to customer support. Some User Content cannot be deleted entirely as it may be needed for tax or other
    purposes by either Eoction or another user. If you choose to remove your User Content or cancel your account, your
    User Content will be removed from public viewing as soon as is practical, (although back-up copies may survive for
    archival and record keeping purposes), provided, however, in certain instances, copies of your User Content may
    continue to exist in published or recorded form when it has been retransmitted, redistributed, or otherwise. We are
    not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any User Content on
    the Services. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or
    without notice.</p>
<p>By submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through the Services, you grant us and our third-party
    service providers and partners a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to
    use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such User Content in any and
    all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed) in connection with the Services, including for
    commercial, advertising and promotional purposes relating to the Services or your items. You agree that this license
    includes the right for us to make such User Content available to other users of the Services, who may also use your

    other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Eoction.</p>
<p>We may need to modify or adapt your User Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer
    networks and in various media and/or make changes to your User Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that
    User Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media and you hereby grant us
    the rights to do so. Eoction claims no ownership of any User Content submitted, posted or displayed by you on or
    through the Services. You retain any and all of your rights to any User Content you submit, post or display on or
    through the Services, subject to the exceptions noted herein, and you are solely responsible for protecting those

<p>All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding your User Content), including all associated
    intellectual property rights, are and will remain the exclusive property of Eoction and its licensors. The Services
    are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Nothing in
    the Terms gives you a right to use the Eoction name or any of the Eoction trademarks, logos, domain names, or other

    agreement. You shall not sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display,

    alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or
    accompanying the Services, including any Content. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding
    Eoction or the Services are entirely voluntary and are the sole and exclusive property of Eoction. You hereby
    irrevocably assign to us all of your right, title and interest in and to such feedback, comments or suggestions, and
    Eoction is free to use them as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on Content and Use of the Services</h2>
<p>We reserve the right at all times (but are not obligated to) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the

<h2>Exclusions</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for
    consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
<h2>Waiver &amp; Severability</h2>
<p>The failure of Eoction to enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable (either by an
    arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the "Dispute Resolution for Consumers" section below or by a court of
    competent jurisdiction, if you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity or
    timely opt out of arbitration as set forth below), the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force
    and effect.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Eoction's prior written
    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
    Eoction may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will
    bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>Any notices or other communications provided by Eoction to you under these Terms, including those regarding
    modifications to these Terms, will be given by Eoction: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices
    made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
<h2>Controlling Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to or
    application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence.</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution for Commercial Entities</h2>
<p>If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, any dispute arising from or
    relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco
    County, California, in English. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
    ("<strong>AAA</strong>") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (the "<strong>AAA
        Commercial Rules</strong>") then in effect. (The AAA Commercial Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
    the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
    "Dispute Resolution for Commercial Entities" section.</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution for Consumers</h2>
<h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
<p>If you are accessing and using the Services as an individual, you and Eoction agree that any dispute, claim or
    controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
    validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding
    arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and
    (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
    threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents
    or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "<strong>IP Protection
        Action</strong>"). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other
    Dispute if you provide Eoction with written notice of your desire to do so by email a help@eoction.com or regular
    mail at Eoction Inc., 292 Lambert Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94306 within thirty (30) days following the date you first
    agree to these Terms (such notice, an "<strong>Arbitration Opt-out Notice</strong>"). If you don't provide Eoction
    with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and
    intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
    The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Eoction with an
    Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California and
    each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide
    Eoction with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Eoction are each waiving the
    right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or
    representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Eoction otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not
    consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or
    representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute
    Resolution for Consumers" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute
    Resolution for Consumers" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Rules</h3>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "<strong>AAA
        Consumer Rules</strong>") then in effect, except as modified by this Section 18.3. (The AAA Consumer Rules are
    available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)
    The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this "Dispute Resolution for
    Consumers" section.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
    specified in the AAA Consumer Rules. (The AAA provides a general <a
        href="https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased">Demand
        for Arbitration</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and
    will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
    arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator
    in accordance with the AAA Consumer Rules.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
<p>Unless you and Eoction otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your
    claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you
    and Eoction submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is
    necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Consumer Rules.
    Subject to the AAA Consumer Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of
    information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<h3>Arbitrator's Decision</h3>
<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitrator's
    decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on
    the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages
    must be consistent with the terms of "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages
    for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
    claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you
    prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided
    under applicable law. Eoction will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to
    recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA
    Consumer Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Eoction will pay all such fees unless
    the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
    frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
    Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the provision regarding changes to these Terms in the "Entire Agreement" section below, if Eoction
    changes this "Dispute Resolution for Consumers" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted
    any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by
    email to <a href="mailto:help@eoction.com">help@eoction.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became
    effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Eoction's email to you notifying you of
    such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Eoction
    in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution for Consumers" section as of the date you first
    accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms, the Seller Rules and the Category Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between Eoction and you
    regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Eoction and you regarding
    the Services. These Terms apply only to Eoction and you. These Terms are not intended to, and shall not, create any
    third party beneficiary rights, except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we make any material changes to these Terms, we will notify you of
    such changes by posting them on the Eoction website or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will
    indicate when such changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions
    become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code &sect;1789.3, you may report complaints to the
    Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by
